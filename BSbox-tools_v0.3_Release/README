About BSbox-tools: Software for representation, defining and computing the most important cryptographic properties of Boolean and Vector Boolean functions (S-boxes)

Current release: v0.3 (alpha)

What is BSbox-tools?

BSbox-tools is developed software for representation, defining and computing the most important cryptographic properties of Boolean and Vector Boolean functions (S-boxes). 
For development of this software is use our CUDA oriented library BoolSPLG (Boolean S-box Properties Library for GPUs), a library with parallel algorithms for Boolean functions and S-boxes for GPU. 
To use this software there is no need knowledge of a programming language. BoolSPL (Boolean S-box parallel library for GPU) provides, reusable software components for every layer of the CUDA programming model. 
BoolSPLG is a library consisting procedures for analysis and compute cryptographic properties of Boolean and Vector Boolean function (S-box). 
Our procedures have function for auto grid conﬁguration. Most of the functions are designed to compute the data in registers because they oﬀer the highest bandwidth.

How do I get started using BSbox-tools? 

For the windows user there need to be have install Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2019 to be able to run and use the BSbox-tools.
